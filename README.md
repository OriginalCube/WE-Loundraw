#  Loundraw Wallpaper
This is a web-based wallpaper, that's inspired from the works of art works of Loundraw. This website allows users to edit the filter color, images, and songs that are already saved in the wallpaper, and it has a
weather api feature that allows the user to display the current weather of the location of the user which can also be set in the wallpaper engine.

## Time to finish 
1.3 month

##  Dev notes
This was a redesign of my first-ever work for my wallpaper engine. This turned out pretty well for the time that it took me to finish this work. This took a lot of effort though because I had to seperate
the images to create a 3d effect with the canvas animation.

## Built with
React js - Front End
