#  Loundraw Wallpaper
This is a web-based wallpaper, that's inspired from the works of art works of Loundraw. This website allows users to edit the filter color, images, and songs that are already saved in the wallpaper, and it has a
weather api feature that allows the user to display the current weather of the location of the user which can also be set in the wallpaper engine.
